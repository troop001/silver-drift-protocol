  "description": "Silver Drift is the fourth protocol in the Sovereign Surge seriesâ€”an NFT drop engineered for clarity, liquidity, and mythic resonance. Minted on Base, this sigil marks a shift from gifting to monetization, from drift to ops mastery. Every mint funds the mythic treasury. Every fragment is lore."
